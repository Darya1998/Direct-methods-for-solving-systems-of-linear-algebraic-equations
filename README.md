Gauss method, The choice of the main element, QR decomposition method, Condition number, Condition number estimation

In this project Gauss algorithm with partial or full selection of the main element is realised to solve systems-of-linear-algebraic-equations. Also method of QR-factorization is realised to solve systems-of-linear-algebraic-equations.
The condition number—ã of matrices are calculated and analyzed.
